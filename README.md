# Project Title: House Sales Price Prediction in King County, USA

## Project Overview  
In this project, I applied data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict house prices in King County, Washington, using the King County House Sales dataset. The dataset includes various attributes of homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, presence of waterfront views, and renovation history.

## Key Highlights:
- **Data Wrangling:** Cleaned the data by handling missing values and dropping irrelevant columns. Replaced missing values in bedrooms and bathrooms with their respective mean values.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Used visualizations to explore correlations between house prices and features like square footage, waterfront view, and condition. Implemented boxplots and regression plots to analyze outliers and feature importance.
- **Model Development:** Developed multiple regression models including:
  - Simple linear regression (using features like square footage and longitude).
  - Multiple linear regression (with a combination of key features like number of floors, waterfront, and grade).
  - Polynomial regression combined with Ridge regression to evaluate complex feature relationships and avoid overfitting.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the models using RÂ² score and mean squared error, and optimized the performance with cross-validation and Ridge regularization to ensure robust predictions.

## Skills & Tools Used:
- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** Linear regression, polynomial regression, Ridge regression, cross-validation, data normalization
- **Data Visualization:** Boxplots, scatter plots, correlation matrices

This project helped me develop a solid understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying machine learning models for real-world regression problems. It also enhanced my ability to evaluate and fine-tune predictive models to achieve better accuracy.
